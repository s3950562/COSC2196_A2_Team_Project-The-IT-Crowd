            <p>Growing up in rural NSW, until I was completed my high school studies, I moved to Adelaide (SA) to further development and grow through life’s experiences and adventures. During my early 20s, I completed my Bachelor of Marketing and Management, and continued to work within the student accommodation sector until 2021. During this time, an opportunity presented to relocate to Melbourne (VIC) which overall helped reenergized my desire to study and work within the IT field. From an early age, I’ve enjoyed working with and around IT, such as working within a small electronics store and an IT department of a hospital during my teenage years.</p>
            <p>My interest in IT sprouted from my experiences growing up; seeing the evolution of technology such as computers, phones and gaming consoles has significantly evolved over my 31 years. These interests stem from the ability to improve the quality of life and enhancing the entertainment, creativity paths it evokes. This passion further blossomed when I began streaming and building a community on Twitch, where I have fostered an inclusive, safe, and welcoming community through modern technological connectiveness.</p>
