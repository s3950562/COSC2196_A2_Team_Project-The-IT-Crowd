Team Profile

Each of you will have produced a personal profile for Assignment 1. You are to assemble this information, reviewing it as you see fit given your feedback from Assignment 1, to produce a team profile. This should be organised into the following subsections.
Team Name
You are free to choose any name for your group that you wish. However, this name will be used to identify your group for the rest of the course, so please choose wisely. You should also keep in mind that this name could be one that comes to the attention of potential employers.
Personal information
One paragraph per person, including name, student number, background, hobbies, IT interest and IT experience. This should also include your teamâ€™s chosen name.
Team Profile
The test outcomes for each person in the team (all 3 tests), and your understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group. You should do this as soon as your group is formed. You will have a chance to reflect on how well the group has worked later.
Condense the relevant content you produced from Assignment 1.

Ideal Jobs

Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. This may have changed due to feedback from Assignment 1. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?
It can be tackled numerous ways in writing and in visual elements. A concise coverage/analysis/conclusion covering all would be good. Strongly recommend a table presentation of comparison data. As it is very easy to highlight a lot of information, simple for others to read and interpret too.
