            <p>Hi my name is Josh and I am from Melbourne, Victoria. I along with the vast majority of my family are Australian born but a few of my older relatives are European immigrants. Last year, I completed my VCE with studies in English, Maths Methods, Chemistry, Economics and Software Development.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy going for long walks/ runs on local trails. While it is a lot rarer to see native birds along the trail (for a variety of reasons), I have always seen the beauty in seeing pairs of rosellas, kookaburras, cockatoos and rainbow lorikeets sitting on branches.</p>

            <h1><span class="bolded">Interest in IT</span></h1>
          </div>

          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p><span class="bolded">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</span></p>
            <p>While my interest to study IT had peaked around last year, I have been studying IT and technology-based electives/subjects throughout high school. Originally, I had primarily enjoyed chemistry and maths but my interest had dropped off near the end of year 12. However, I really enjoyed software development in year 12 and I wanted to study more.</p>
            <p>Another major reason I wanted to study software was because both my parents have degrees in computer science and worked in IT. After seeing the diversity of IT and their different jobs, I desire to follow in their footsteps and work in IT.</p>
            <p>The majority of my IT experience has been at school – particularly software 3&4, I have completed minor side projects that I later implemented into my main SAT. Otherwise I have no work or post -high school education on the subject.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</span></p>
            <p>One reason I wanted to study at RMIT was because it has a strong link with industry. Both my parents recommended to me Swinburne and RMIT since they have a strong link to industry and the majority of their colleges have either studied at Swinburne or RMIT.</p>
            <p>I also chose to study this course at RMIT (through OUA) because it had the option to be studied online. This allows me to be more flexible with other life commitments. While I do not currently hold a job, the course can be easily planned and worked around my working hours when I eventually get one.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</span></p>
            <p>During my studies I want to build my knowledge of IT and develop my skills so I am able to analyse and solve a variety of IT problems. I also plan to improve my presentation and teamwork skills within a professional environment – particularly with the upcoming assessments.</p>
            <p>Last year in software development 3/4, I studied Visual Basic Community as my primary language. While it did teach me the basics of coding, other languages can provide me with the depth and structure to create different programs.</p>
            <p>I would also like to learn about different types of software development models. Last year I learnt about 3 development models: Waterfall, Spiral and Agile. Through studying this course, I want to learn how this process is fully run in a business setting along with other models used within the industry.</p>

            <h2><span class="bolded">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Through completing these tests, I learned a lot about myself. The results provided a more tangible insight of my personality type and learning style in a professional setting.</p>
            <p>The tests indicate that I am an introverted but a hard and loyal worker (i.e. defender). As indicated on the Myers-Briggs test I desire to be a loyal and dedicated worker who helps the team achieve their best. I am realistic and practical; I prefer creating solid plans and sticking to them unless a better alternative is proposed.</p>
            <p>However, my personality type comes with some weaknesses. I do have a habit of overburdening myself with too much work which can generate stress even though I am just trying to meet my own expectations. Sometimes I also struggle communicating my issues to avoid conflict with other group members.</p>
            <p>My big 5 personality test also aligns with my personality test. The test indicated that I am greatly introverted and prefer working on more organised long-term goals than short term benefits. The tests also indicated that I am not really open with observing art complex self-expression. Finally, the test indicated that I am more agreeable being empathetic to other but have a higher tendency to experience negative emotions.</p>
            <p>When it comes to learning new topics, my learning style test indicated that I am primarily a visual learner. I prefer to write down notes about what I am learning and often link them to a visual image. I tend to work at my best with visual learning material.</p>
            <h2><span class="bolded">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>My results may influence me to be a positive member to my team. While I am not the best leader (or desire to go for that position), I will try my best to be a strong and loyal team player and get my work done on time. I tend to avoid conflict in team environments which can be beneficial to reducing team friction. However, I struggle to voice my own issues which can be a problem at times.</p>
            <h2><span class="bolded">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When looking for a team I should try to find people that I can connect with well. By “connect” I mean can collaborate with easily and share the same interests and motivations when completing the project. While I am not the best at it, I enjoy collaborating with peers in a constructive environment. From personal experience and the results, I find it hard to work in highly competitive teams due to my sensitive nature and aversion to conflict.</p>
