            <p>Hi my name is Josh and I am from Melbourne, Victoria. Last year, I completed my VCE with studies in English, Maths Methods, Chemistry, Economics and Software Development. While my interest to study IT had peaked around last year (in place of a chemistry pathway), I have enjoyed studying IT and technology-based electives/subjects throughout high school. The majority of my IT experience has been completing my SAT for Software Development 3&4. My SAT got me to learn and apply my software development skills to create a functioning software solution (with Visual Basic) for a given problem. In my spare time I enjoy playing video games and taking long walks along my local trail.</p>

            <h2><span class="bolded">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Through completing these tests, I learned a lot about myself. The results provided a more tangible insight of my personality type and learning style in a professional setting.</p>
            <p>The tests indicate that I am an introverted but a hard and loyal worker (i.e. defender). As indicated on the Myers-Briggs test I desire to be a loyal and dedicated worker who helps the team achieve their best. I am realistic and practical; I prefer creating solid plans and sticking to them unless a better alternative is proposed.</p>
            <p>However, my personality type comes with some weaknesses. I do have a habit of overburdening myself with too much work which can generate stress even though I am just trying to meet my own expectations. Sometimes I also struggle communicating my issues to avoid conflict with other group members.</p>
            <p>My big 5 personality test also aligns with my personality test. The test indicated that I am greatly introverted and prefer working on more organised long-term goals than short term benefits. The tests also indicated that I am not really open with observing art complex self-expression. Finally, the test indicated that I am more agreeable being empathetic to other but have a higher tendency to experience negative emotions.</p>
            <p>When it comes to learning new topics, my learning style test indicated that I am primarily a visual learner. I prefer to write down notes about what I am learning and often link them to a visual image. I tend to work at my best with visual learning material.</p>
            <h2><span class="bolded">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>My results may influence me to be a positive member to my team. While I am not the best leader (or desire to go for that position), I will try my best to be a strong and loyal team player and get my work done on time. I tend to avoid conflict in team environments which can be beneficial to reducing team friction. However, I struggle to voice my own issues which can be a problem at times.</p>
            <h2><span class="bolded">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When looking for a team I should try to find people that I can connect with well. By “connect” I mean can collaborate with easily and share the same interests and motivations when completing the project. While I am not the best at it, I enjoy collaborating with peers in a constructive environment. From personal experience and the results, I find it hard to work in highly competitive teams due to my sensitive nature and aversion to conflict.</p>
