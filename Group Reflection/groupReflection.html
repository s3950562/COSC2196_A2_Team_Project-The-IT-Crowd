    <h2>Liked </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>We found that our personalities were complimentary, and we each brought different ideas/perspectives to the project, as a whole it really worked.</li>
        <li>Everyone filled a role and there was no conflict, we supported each other when we needed to without any resentment.</li>
        <li>The dynamic was very collaborative and there was no judgment despite each of us having to speak freely and voice personal issues that needed to be raised to manage the project.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Learned </h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>To create To Do lists earlier in the project would have been beneficial.</li>
        <li>There was a steep learning curve to use Teams and Github effectively.</li>
        <li>It is better to communicate and raise issues and be transparent with the team to deal with things than dwell on them individually.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Lacked </h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Initially we lacked a plan with milestones to drive the project forward.</li>
        <li>We didn’t use meeting agendas effectively so we would often go off track in meetings.</li>
        <li>We lost one member during the project as he stopped contributing and didn’t respond to our communication with him.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h6>Longed for</h6>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>We only had a small team and needed more time and human resources to divide the work up.</li>
        <li>Some members of the team would have preferred to use a Discord, OneDrive and Github combination of tools as an alternative to using Teams.</li>
        <li>We found the time taken to do the assignment has made it difficult to keep up with the modules for Introduction to IT and will have to now catch up on these.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>I found the personalities in our group were very compatible and I felt very comfortable to be myself and to speak honestly and openly when I didn’t understand something or about my contribution. My teammates were very supportive as I had to go away for a long weekend, and I also celebrated a big milestone birthday so had a lot going on in my personal life however we all discussed our competing priorities and helped each other. I was able to provide a person to interview for the Work element and I think the team responded well to this interviewee and found him very interesting.</p>
    <p>I contributed basic HTML from the content I created however I was not involved in applying the CSS to these files due to the sheer pressure of dividing up the work and getting a lot of content written. In assignment 3 I would like to get more involved in the HTML side of things to make sure I am furthering this skill.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed the team meetings and I look forward to working with my team for the rest of the unit.</p>
