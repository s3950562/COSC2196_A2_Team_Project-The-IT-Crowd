                  <li>Some members of the team would have preferred to use a Discord, OneDrive and Github combination of tools as an alternative to using Teams.</li>
                  <li>We found the time taken to do the assignment has made it difficult to keep up with the modules for Introduction to IT and will have to now catch up on these.</li>

              <p>I found the personalities in our group were very compatible and I felt very comfortable to be myself and to speak honestly and openly when I didn’t understand something or about my contribution. My teammates were very supportive as I had to go away for a long weekend, and I also celebrated a big milestone birthday so had a lot going on in my personal life however we all discussed our competing priorities and helped each other. I was able to provide a person to interview for the Work element and I think the team responded well to this interviewee and found him very interesting.</p>
              <p>I contributed basic HTML from the content I created however I was not involved in applying the CSS to these files due to the sheer pressure of dividing up the work and getting a lot of content written. In assignment 3 I would like to get more involved in the HTML side of things to make sure I am furthering this skill.</p>
              <p>I enjoyed the team meetings and I look forward to working with my team for the rest of the unit.</p>

              <h3><span class="bolded">Joshua:</span></h3>
              <p>Overall, I enjoyed the experience of working with our group for A2. Our combination of skills, experience and talents worked well when creating the final project. We were able to divide up the work to better suit our strengths. This worked particularly well when managing the content along with the backend and frontend development of the website. While we didn't have clear milestones at the start, we were able to collaborate well and set some milestones to achieve by the end of the assignment. While buggy at times, MS teams helped us keep track of our goals and files as we progressed through the assignment.</p>
              <p>Another aspect of our group that I enjoyed is that we were all open to each other when discussing the project. Vanessa and Tim (along with myself) kept in regular contact with each other, so we all understood how far we each were with completing our project. I felt confident to speak openly to both Tim and Vanessa about elements of the project if I needed assistance.</p>
              <p>It was nice working alongside a couple of like-minded individuals, and I am looking forward to working with this group again going into A3.</p>
