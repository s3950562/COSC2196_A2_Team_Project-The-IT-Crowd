    <p>Our group listed Software Engineers and Data Scientist as the ideal jobs in Assignment 1.</p>
    <p>Software Engineers are seen as the 11th most in demand job title by employers according to data provided by Burning Glass.</p>
    <p>Data Scientist is a relatively new profession, and it is difficult to find data on the employer demand in this area as it is usually categorized under the inaccurate labor force category of Actuary or Statistician</p>
    <p>However, there are many articles available online that recognize the high demand for this skill. </p>
    <p>An article on the RMIT website outlines research which calculates the number of qualified data scientists graduating annually vs the number of data science jobs being advertised and the numbers show that there is a clear undersupply of data scientists.</p>
    <p>Despite it being a relative new job and difficult to find demand data there are currently many jobs in this area, and it is seen as a growth area for the future.</p>
    <p>The following table shows the general and IT specific skills identified as needed for the job advertisements our group chose as their ideal jobs and how in demand each of these skills are as ranked by the Burning Glass data provided by RMIT.</p>

  <p>Vanessa – The Burning Glass data has not changed my opinion on the Data Science job. <p>
  <p>Burning Glass data does not list Data Science jobs specifically however these roles are becoming more common.</p>
  <p>Data Science is a growth area in IT and still an area that interests me.</p>
  <p>According to an article in LinkedIn in February 2022 Data Scientists are in high demand. </p>
  <p>There has been a 344% increase in jobs since 2013. </p>
  <p>I have also been researching one of the tools used in Data Science which has been as the Data Science defacto standard, Jupyter.</p>
  <p>It is exploding in use on Github, a code sharing repository</p>
