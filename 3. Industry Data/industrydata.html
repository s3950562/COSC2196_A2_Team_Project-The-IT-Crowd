            <p>Our group listed Software Engineers and Data Scientist as the ideal jobs in Assignment 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Data Scientist</span> is a relatively new profession, and it is difficult to find data on the employer demand in this area as it is usually categorized under the inaccurate labor force category of Actuary or Statistician. However, there are many articles available online that recognize the high demand for this skill. An article on the RMIT website outlines research which calculates the number of qualified data scientists graduating annually vs the number of data science jobs being advertised and the numbers show that there is a clear undersupply of data scientists<a href="https://studyonline.rmit.edu.au/blog/are-we-facing-oversupply-data-scientists" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>. Despite it being a relative new job and difficult to find demand data there are currently many jobs in this area, and it is seen as a growth area for the future.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Software Engineers</span> are seen as the 11th most in demand job title by employers according to data provided by Burning Glass. Software engineers can specialise within multiple roles such as security, data, frontend, backend and full stack engineering<a href="https://hired.com/2022-state-of-software-engineers/" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

                <p><span class="bolded">Vanessa</span> – The Burning Glass data has not changed my opinion on the Data Science job. The Burning Glass data does not list Data Science jobs specifically however these roles are becoming more common. Data Science is a growth area in IT and still an area that interests me. According to an article in LinkedIn in February 2022 Data Scientists are in high demand. There has been a 344% increase in jobs since 2013<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fastest-growing-jobs-2022-linux" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a>. I have also been researching one of the tools used in Data Science which has been as the Data Science defacto standard, Jupyter. It is exploding in use on Github, a code sharing repository<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1/" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
                <p><span class="bolded">Josh</span> – Overall, my opinion on entering a software engineering job hasn’t changed after analysing the Burning Glass data. Being a software engineer requires having a variety of skills, both generalized and specialised skills. My line of work requires that I have strong communication and problem solving skills which are ranked 1st and 2nd on the general skills list. Along with the ability to work independently and analytically (ranked 10th and 17th) However, also having strong experience with Java – which is an important skill (ranked 3rd) – along with HTML5/CSS and React/Angular which ranked 17th. Currently demand for backend and full stack developers has increased by 33% last year <a href="https://hired.com/2022-state-of-software-engineers/" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a> which is a strong indicator that these skills will be applicable to a wide variety of software engineering professions in the coming future.</p>
