              <p>As the CEO Sam oversees the running of the company at a higher level across all disciplines. He has a technical background which helps him understand the complexities of the field however he has mostly high-level interactions. He stated that he “runs the company day in day out operationally, strategically and commercially”. He spends a lot of time communicating with clients to build the business. He also has non-IT related work involved in running a business such as admin, HR, marketing, and advertising.</p>
              <p>He employs executive level managers in operations, sales, products, and innovation so they run teams which are doing the technical work.</p>

              <p>Sam interacts with his own staff, walking the floor making sure he is present and encouraging. He also spends a lot of time with clients, he sees this as a vital part of his role making sure they are happy and if they have any issues, they can contact him or the CIO of the company. He also thinks it is valuable to build relationships with his competitors and other vendors to understand what else is happening in the marketplace. He spends time travelling and looking out for emerging technologies to see what is resonating and having success in other parts of the world so he can learn from them. Although the company is self-sufficient, he has had interactions with investors and periodically he catches up with them however doesn’t typically go searching for them at this point. He also is on panels for different government departments and uses lobbyists to push his company as it is a wholly Australian owned and staffed company which resonates with the government. He also interacts with politicians interested in the emerging technologies space. Delv developed the Coronavirus app and the COVID safe app as they had worked with the government on many large projects and had proven under tight deadlines and constraints they could deliver.</p>

              <p>When he was setting up the company he wore multiple hats, CEO, CFO, Business Development Manager, engineer etc. Now he oversees the company as the CEO, and he finds it vital to use resources to do this. He automates as much as he can using AI, ML, robotic process automation and tools that help him make sure things are running seamlessly. He would prefer to spend his efforts engaging with clients getting more work and delivering more work. This gives him the power of revenue to reinvest in the company and the ability to build the company and hire more people with the right skill set around him.</p>

Also, the CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) platform is an automated system which verifies that a cloud has been configured correctly when it was originally set up and runs checks to ensure the cloud infrastructure is free from risks.</p>

              <p>Sam finds the most challenging part of his position the frustration of working with staff who don’t meet deadlines or who don’t follow up with clients when they have promised to do so. He admits he is “a control freak with attention to detail”. If something is escalated to him by a client, for instance they are having difficulty getting a response from a Delv employee he needs to deal with this to make sure it doesn’t happen again as he is focused on customer experience.</p>
