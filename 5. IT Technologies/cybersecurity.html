          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting data and digital assets from external threats. During the 2020-2021 Financial Year the Australian Cyber Security Centre observed 67,500 cybercrime reports and a total self-reported losses of $33 billion due to cybercrime. As the use of technology increases so too does the need for protection of our data and devices.</p>
            <p><img src="CyberattackSurface.png" alt"The growing Cyber attack surface" style="width:500px;height:500;"></p>
            <p>Cyberattacks come in many forms, some common examples are:</p>

            <div id="dotPoints_Ref" class="quickFade delayFour">
              <ul>
                <li>Malware – viruses used to maliciously cause harm to systems.</li>
                <li>Ransomware – like Malware however steals confidential data and demands currency in exchange for access or to avoid public shaming.</li>
                <li>Phishing/Social Engineering – legitimate looking emails and messages are used to trick people into supplying their sensitive information. There has been an increase in this due to the pandemic and many people working remotely.</li>
        	      <li>DDoS – Distribute Denial of Service attack on a website making it crash forcing downtime.</li>
        	      <li>APTs – Advanced Persistent Threats, an intruder(s) infiltrates a system without being detected and spies on business operations and sensitive information often for prolonged periods.</li>
                <li>Man-in-the-middle – an intruder eavesdrops/intercepts messages on unsecure networks to steal data.</li>
                <li>Backdoor Trojan – hackers create a weakness in a victim’s system which allows them access remotely.</li>
                <li>XSS attack – Cross-site scripting, hackers insert malicious code usually in JavaScript to steal user information.</li>
                <li>SQL injection – a hacker inserts SQL statements into legitimate website’s SQL code to potentially steal information or even destroy a database.</li>
                <li>Supply Chain attack – malicious actors can compromise widely used supply chain software products to disrupt networks.</li>
                <li>Cyberwarfare – the use of cyberattack by one nation state against another to steal information or disrupt society such as the banking industry to destabilize. A cyberespionage tool most likely developed by Russia called Energetic Bear was used to access company networks in the energy sector in countries including US, Spain, Japan and Germany.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p><img src="CyberIncidents.png" alt"The number of Cyber incidents by category" style="width:500px;height:500;"></p>
            <p>The costs of implementing cybersecurity strategies that are comprehensive and use best practices are justified as the costs of cyberattacks are extensive and cause major disruptions.
            These costs include lost revenue, lack of consumer trust and the cost of responding to breaches.
            Where Critical Infrastructure such as Energy, Telecommunications and Hospitals are the target of cyber-attacks there is also potential for harm or loss of life.</p>
            <p>Currently cybersecurity covers five main areas,</p>

            <h1><span class="bolded">How does Cyber-Security affect us?</span></h1>
          </div>

          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p>With an increased number of people working remotely due to the COVID pandemic there has been an increase in vulnerability to both individuals and businesses. There has been a fast-track approach to allowing people to work remotely and unfortunately malicious actors have seized this opportunity to attack vulnerable networks . We are all aware of how difficult life becomes when we no longer have access to the technology that enables us to live. We are so dependent on smart phones, devices, the internet, and critical infrastructure that if there is any downtime, we are to some extent unable to function properly. If we are a victim of identity theft or monetary theft due to cybercrime the outcome is even worse.</p>
            <p>With the IoT and an increase on our dependence on devices connected to the internet we are opening ourselves to further vulnerabilities. Before purchasing a device, consumers must ensure that it is secure and made by a reputable manufacturer. IoT devices should not contain powerful functionality that in the wrong hands makes the device a weapon. Consumers must check for default settings on devices, passwords should be able to be changed from those set by the manufacturer. The device should also have a clear upgrade path otherwise the device may remain toxic if bug fixes cannot be applied. In 2016 a man was killed whilst being a passenger in a self-driving car which is an example of where despite all effort’s technology is still fallible and can cause harm. In this case no malicious actor was involved however it shows how in the wrong hands devices and machinery could potentially cause injury or death.</p>
            <p>With the introduction of the cloud many of us have transferred our sensitive data to large cloud companies where the onus is on them to protect our data. However, this has also led to an increase in cloud breaches. </p>

            <h1><span class="bolded">What can be done now?</span></h1>
          </div>

          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p>Cyber-attacks are increasing all the time and they are becoming more sophisticated. The government including the Australian Cyber Security Agency is continuing to create frameworks and guidelines to educate individuals and organizations on technology and practices they should employ to minimize risks. It is the responsibility of anyone connected to the internet to understand how to best protect themselves and their data.</p>
            <p>At present we can use people, processes, and technology to reduce the risks of cyberattack.</p>
            <p>People: Individuals should be on the lookout for suspicious URL’s and emails, frequently change and secure passwords, don’t share personal information on social media, backup files, update software to most recent versions, use malware/antivirus software and don’t leave devices unattended or unsecured. Another important factor is education, if consumers are aware of the potential risks they can be better protected and prepared. The eSafety Commissioner is a great resource for learning about how to avoid cyber bullying/attacks.  Unfortunately, people also pose a problem for insider threats, where people have access to a system, they can also sabotage. There must be protections in place such as unique login ids, restricted access, deactivation of access after a person leaves an organization and security policies. Verizon found in 2021 that 22% of security related incidents were attributed to insiders.</p>
            <p>Processes: There are 3 main processes involved in cybersecurity - identifying threats, protecting information and infrastructure, and responding to attacks. Each of these processes is complex and with new advancements in technology improvements are developing all the time such as with AI and machine learning capabilities to identify threats. </p>
            <p>As awareness grows organizations should follow processes to avoid destructive attacks. One such process is to ensure organizations are regularly running offsite backups of their sensitive information. Ransomware attacks are becoming more prevalent for small businesses where a ransom is demanded in return for data. Regular backups eliminate the risk of this being a successful strategy by organized cyber criminals as sensitive data can be restored easily from backup. Paying a ransom in return for data is usually a short-term solution and the attack is often repeated.</p>
            <p>Technology: There are many software and hardware options to protect individuals and organizations against cyber-attacks. These include DNS filtering, malware protection, antivirus software, firewalls, and email security systems. Also, the CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) platform is an automated system which verifies that a cloud has been configured correctly when it was originally set up and runs checks to ensure the cloud infrastructure is free from risks.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p>State of the art technologies are being used to improve cybersecurity success. For example, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are being used to prevent attacks. We now have powerful tools that help predict and prevent cyberattacks with developments in UBA (User Behavior Analytics) and UBI (User Behavior Intelligence) providing powerful information to organizations. UBA is an automated process of gathering data about user activity and then flagging any anomalies. We have SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) which is a useful tool for analysing patterns behind a firewall however UBA looks for suspicious behavior before a breach can occur. This can prevent attacks in real-time such as, where a system is accessed from an unknown location or there is an increase in network traffic, either of these could indicate suspicious behavior from a malicious actor and the system can lock out potentially harmful activity.</p>
