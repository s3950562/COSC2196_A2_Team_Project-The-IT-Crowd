<h1> What does it do? (600 words) </h1>
	
<p>Cloud computing at its core is the use of traditional computing services via the internet, which is what we refer to as ‘the cloud’. Microsoft Azure states that the clouds potential means it can deliver services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the cloud to offering faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scales (What Is Cloud Computing? A Beginner’s Guide | Microsoft Azure, n.d.). Effectively, cloud computing gives the ability for users to access, store and modify data on a device that is saved back to a data center for access when required.</p>

<p>There are key advantages that the cloud service has over an traditional computing service, such as the scalability, storage, data security, data loss protection, and ongoing maintenance (Simplilearn, 2020):</p>

	Scalability
	- Cloud computing allows you to pay per how much is nominated to have access to, and is generally easier to size up or down when required. Additionally, maintenance costs of the cloud are either not applicable or is usually absorbed in the ongoing cost of the cloud service. 
	- In contrast to an on-premises infrastructure arrangement, an initial investiment with ongoing maintenance costs applies run and maintain efficently. Though downsizing on-premise infrastructure is possible, the process can be at a loss and a timely exercise to complete.

<p>With the rise and innovation of cloud computing, so to comes the broadening of its scope. Today, cloud computing not only refers to the process, but the infrastructure technology that is used to make the cloud work. Further, infrastructure can be adapted and utilized in arrangements of both physical and virtual technology, depending on the service requirements for the cloud to work.</p>

<p>Virtualized infrastructure may include services, operating system software, networks, and infrastructure that can abstract, pool, divide and store data to overcome the restrictions of physical hardware (Vennam, n.d.) are required for the cloud to work efficiently.</p>


	<h2> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h2>
		
	<p>Since the beginning of 2020, our lives overall have undertaken an unprecedented rate of adaptation with cloud technology; whether it has been noticed or not. This shifting to the cloud was further accelerated for our desire to maintain a sense of connectiveness and normality, as well ensuring efficency and accurate transferring of data between destinations. Inturn, this vertical adaptation can be attributed to the overall increases to the volume, velocity and variety of (new) data being generated from services and processes. (Alashhab et al., 2021) This sudden shift saw massive, fastpaced growth with the cloud and feasability for the services that the cloud provides.</p>
	
	<p>Social media utilizes the cloud for the holding and transferring of media-type data, such as videos, pictures, audio and live streaming services. As the 

	<p>We can support this by observing key areas of business performance as an indicator. For example, NVIDIA in February 2022, as a dominant player for data centers, reported continued and solid growth; NVIDIA saw a 71% revenue increase from a year ago and 11% from the previous quarter alone (NVIDIA Newsroom, 2022). This continous year-on-year growth can be attributed to the constant hunger for data storage as the cloud becomes more significant and utilised within our lives. Further, the IDC reported in 2020 that approximately 52% of global IT and general business leaders surveyed are likely to maintain in some form 'working from home arrangements beyond the current pandemic (Muscolino et al., 2020), supporting the notion of the continuous growth in data centers and cloud storage.</p>
	
	<p>The vertical adaptation of cloud technology is not limited to the workplace and our social connectiveness; as we have significant embracement from sectors such as governments, healthcare, banking, manufacturing, self-driving vehicles, video gaming, streaming services, and so on. All of which, have tilted heavily on the cloud and its services to provide
