              <p>Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that utilises algorithms and solid data to imitate human learning. ML is used in place of large teams of data scientists to process and categorise data based off its existing understanding of previous datasets. While ML dates back as far as the 1960s with the invention of the computerised checkers machine [IBM, 15/7/2020], ML has rose in popularity and importance over the past few years.</p>
              <p>The primary focus of ML is to “[get] computers to act without being explicitly programmed” [Stanford University, n.d] to do so. Utilising their own programmed learning model, machines constantly improve their analysis by referring to their backlog of previous data sets they have interpreted.</p>

              <h1><span class="bolded">How does ML work and what types of ML are there? </span></h1>
            </div>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <p>ML works through a constant loop of interpreting data, evaluating its success and optimising itself (aka a model). According to Dr Michael Tamir, ML models can be broken down into 3 components: “A decision process”, “An error function” and “an updating or optimisation process” (All are from M.Tamir, 26/6/2020).</p>
              <p><span class="bolded">A decision process</span> is a set of a set of calculations and steps taken by a machine to find a pattern in its existing dataset to return an interpretative guess of the current data it is analysing.</p>
              <p><span class="bolded">An error function</span> is a method the machine conducts to determine how confident their guess is correct (typically as a percentage). The machine uses this to compare its response to the accuracy of its own model.</p>
              <p><span class="bolded">An updating or optimisation process</span> is an algorithm that interprets the machine’s failures (from the error function) and updates its decision process to ensure the failure isn’t repeated. The more data the machine processes the more optimised and accurate it is.</p>

              <p>While similar in their core processing, machines can have different learning models depending on what type of data they must predict. Ed Burns from Tech Target states that “There are four basic approaches [to ML]: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning” [Burns, March 2021].</p>

              <p><span class="bolded">Supervised learning</span> is a model where “data scientists supply [the machine’s] algorithms with labelled training data” [Burns, March 2021] – which is often user data – to test how the machine’s algorithm correlates and classifies the data.</p>
              <p><span class="bolded">Unsupervised learning</span> is the opposite approach to supervised learning where the machine has to detect its own patterns and relationships from a set of unlabelled data. This is used primarily when labelled data doesn’t exist or is too hard gather.</p>
              <p><span class="bolded">Semi-supervised learning</span> is a combination of the previous two learning models. A smaller dataset is provided with labels for the machine to get a basic understanding of the classifications. However, they are also given the task to sort a set of unlabelled data into the existing labelled set.</p>
              <p><span class="bolded">Reinforcement learning</span> is a model where a machine processes the data itself based off a set sequence. Data scientists then give it positive or negative cues [Burns, March 2021] based on its ability to process the data accurately. The machine then uses these cues to improve the way they process data. </p>
              <p>Unlike the previous types of learning (aka “non-deep learning” [source IBM, n.d]), <span class="bolded">Deep learning</span> is a model (which is a subset of machine learning) used to fully automate the data learning process without any form of human intervention. Machines using deep learning automatically process uncategorised and unfiltered data (including text and images) and determine its own categories. Deep learning is primarily used to process larger datasets along with being credited in “accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition” [IBM, n.d]. </p>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <p>In its current state machine learning is extremely powerful tool used to process data across a variety of industries. ML improves the efficiency of businesses so they can process larger amounts of data at extremely fast rates and provide detailed insight in their current operations. According to an analytical insight by SAS, businesses use to improve their operations and gain a “strong advantage over their competitors” [SAS, n.d]. Larger industries rely on the efficiency of ML to optimise the overall efficiency of their business. </p>
              <p>Banks all over the world use ML to “provide important insights in data and prevent fraud” [SAS, n.d]. The transportation industry uses ML to identify patterns and trends of existing routes which is used to “increase the profitability of their operations” [SAS, n.d]. While, retail businesses also use ML to analyse buying history which can be used to “personalise the client’s shopping experience” [SAS, n.d]. However, these examples barely scratch the surface in what ML can be used for in modern day society and most sectors that process data use some form of ML [refer to image].</p>

              <p>Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a neural machine learning model developed by OpenAI used to produce pieces of text, translate languages and create code similar to how a human would in its place. GPT uses deep learning (more specially neural learning) to teach the algorithm to write accurate and engaging texts for the user. </p>

              <p><center>Source: <a href="https://n2.eco/n2-technology-blog/wow-its-openai-gpt-3-time/">N2</a></center></p>

              <p>While the latest version – GPT-3 – was released in 2020, the next version of the program (GPT-4) is set to release in 2023. According to an article written by Alberto Romero, “GTP-4 will have 100 trillion parameters” which is “500 [times] the size of GTP-3” [Both are Romero, 12/9/21]. With these extra features and developments, GPT-4 is intended to provide additional services similar to more specialised systems such as Dall-E’s text to image based system along with Codex’s coding system [Romero, 12/9/21].</p>
              <p>When ML and more broadly AI is developed further in the future to include more complex human features such at body/facial expressions, reasoning and common sense; GPT-4 will be an extremely strong generalist model for creation of human texts/ code.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <p>As mentioned before, ML has become increasingly popular over time as more time and money has been dedicated to improve ML’s capabilities. In the last four years the number of businesses adopting ML has increased by 270% with more than nine in ten leading businesses having ongoing investments in AI and ML [both from Ying Lin (Oberlo), 12/2/2022]. As stated above, in the future we see ML models becoming closer to replicating human learning and neural pathways. With further development in machines being able to apply human reasoning and recognise human features – such as facial expressions, ML (and AI more broadly) will become almost indistinguishable from human learning.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <p>In the future, ML and more broadly AI will cause a shift in jobs across a variety of areas of industry – particularly in technology. ML tools and systems has improved the overall efficiency and productivity of modern businesses. While ML and AI may eventually be developed enough to replace human workers for some basic jobs, Forbes asserts that “AI will probably not make human workers obsolete, at least not for a long time” [Ashley Stahl, 10/3/21]. AI and ML (currently) can’t replace human reasoning and critical judgement; hence it still has a strong reliance on human workers to fill in what the machine is missing. The global AI and ML market is expected to increase to $641.3 billion by 2028 [Ying Lin (Oberlo), 12/2/2022] with many more jobs being created centred around AI and ML.</p>
              <p>Developments in ML will also change how regular people interact with computer systems and businesses. As of last year, 15% of customer service interactions are powered by ML [Ying Lin (Oberlo), 12/2/2022] and still set to grow. Better machine learning model practices will improve (rather than make redundant) client interaction with systems such as voice assistance apps (Siri, Google assistant, Cortana, etc), search engines (Google, Bing, Firefox) and autonomous vehicles. With the aforementioned developments into complex human features, client-machine interactions will be almost identical to human-human ones.</p>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <p>ML has always had a strong impact in my daily life, it has just been growing stronger with further developments into ML. For example, the search/ recommendation engines run by Google, YouTube and my streaming services. Of these services they all store data about me and my watching/ viewing habits to create recommendations (and in some cases advertising + product recommendations) based on previous experience with other users. ML is also used to detect malicious activity/ spam across my devices such as my phone, systems and mailboxes (i.e. Gmail and outlook).</p>

              <p>With further developments in ML, I see that I will be interacting with more virtual systems over their human agents in both a physical and virtual setting. Some mundane jobs such as basic helpdesk and customer support personal being replaced by computers that can accurately predict a correct solution to the issue. I also predict that self-driving cars become more mainstream (potential as a taxi/ uber service) with further developments into how they learn.</p>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <p>ML has a similar impact on my family and friends – the difference is what mediums of media they use. For example, my parents shop a lot more than I do – particularly online – and as a result get more advertising and promotions centred around their shopping. A friend of mine also has a google nest in their home that they use from time to time to search up specific pieces of information while cooking or doing chores. Throughout each of these devices/ apps, machines store and reuse my friend's and family's data to provide a variety of recommendations, ideas and/ or advertisements.</p>
