            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that utilises algorithms and solid data to imitate human learning. ML is used in place of large teams of data scientists to process and categorise data based off its existing understanding of previous datasets. While ML dates back as far as the 1960s with the invention of the computerised checkers machine [IBM, 15/7/2020], ML has rose in popularity and importance over the past few years.</p>
            <p>The primary focus of ML is to “[get] computers to act without being explicitly programmed” [Stanford University, n.d] to do so. Utilising their own programmed learning model, machines constantly improve their analysis by referring to their backlog of previous data sets they have interpreted.</p>

          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p>ML works through a constant loop of interpreting data, evaluating its success and optimising itself (aka a model). According to Dr Michael Tamir, ML models can be broken down into 3 components: “A decision process”, “An error function” and “an updating or optimisation process” (All are from M.Tamir, 26/6/2020).</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">A decision process</span> is a set of a set of calculations and steps taken by a machine to find a pattern in its existing dataset to return an interpretative guess of the current data it is analysing.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">An error function</span> is a method the machine conducts to determine how confident their guess is correct (typically as a percentage). The machine uses this to compare its response to the accuracy of its own model.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">An updating or optimisation process</span> is an algorithm that interprets the machine’s failures (from the error function) and updates its decision process to ensure the failure isn’t repeated. The more data the machine processes the more optimised and accurate it is.</p>

            <p>While similar in their core processing, machines can have different learning models depending on what type of data they have to predict. Ed Burns from Tech Target states that “There are four basic approaches [to ML]: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning” [Burns, March 2021].</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Supervised learning</span> is a model where “data scientists supply [the machine’s] algorithms with labelled training data” [Burns, March 2021] – which is often user data – to test how the machine’s algorithm correlates and classifies the data.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Unsupervised learning</span> is the opposite approach to supervised learning where the machine has to detect its own patterns and relationships from a set of unlabelled data. This is used primarily when labelled data doesn’t exist or is too hard gather.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Semi-supervised learning</span> is a combination of the previous two learning models. A smaller dataset is provided with labels for the machine to get a basic understanding of the classifications. However, they are also given the task to sort a set of unlabelled data into the existing labelled set.</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Reinforcement learning</span> is a model where a machine processes the data itself based off a set sequence. Data scientists then give it positive or negative cues [Burns, March 2021] based on its ability to process the data accurately. The machine then uses these cues to improve the way they process data. </p>
            <p>Unlike the previous types of learning (aka “non-deep learning” [source IBM, n.d]), <span class="bolded">Deep learning</span> is a model (which is a subset of machine learning) used to fully automate the data learning process without any form of human intervention. Machines using deep learning automatically process uncategorised and unfiltered data (including text and images) and determine its own categories. Deep learning is primarily used to process larger datasets along with being credited in “accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition” [IBM, n.d]. </p>
