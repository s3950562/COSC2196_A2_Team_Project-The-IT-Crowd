              <p>We would like to create a mobile app which uses our own mobile data to make further predictive recommendations based on previously known interests in literature, films and TV. This technology is already being used and similar functionality is being deployed within algorithms developed and used by Youtube and Google where suggestions are displayed based on past use. However, this idea allows you to take ownership of your recommendations. It is not based on large corporations feeding you information to keep you online for longer, subjecting you to more advertising and information supplied by paying customers. This app will keep track of things that you have liked and continues to recommend and curate further cultural options which will interest you and expand your knowledge. We have a 1:1 relationship with our smart phone, it is the perfect tool to harness knowledge about us, so we can use our leisure time effectively.</p>

              <p>How often do we procrastinate for ages about what to watch or read next? The internet already predictively feeds us information based on prior habits and can have a narrowing effect on what we are exposed to which can have a negative impact, consider conspiracy theories for example where people have gone so far down a rabbit hole they have skewed their perception or beliefs and the information they are being exposed to may become less and less relevant the more time they spend online. The purpose of this app is to understand our interests in culture and offer suggestions for further exploration based on these interests and yet be intelligent enough to broaden our knowledge, not narrow it. The internet is vast and overwhelming, current algorithms are not ideally designed to expand our knowledge; we may miss opportunities due to the sheer amount of information available. This functionality does already exist to some extent however we believe it is a growth area and can be fine-tuned at a personal level to allow a person with a smart phone to be offered suggestions immediately as to what to read/watch next to enhance their lives.</p>

              <p>The app is stored on your mobile device and can be quite simple in design, however, has potential to be exceptionally broad and far reaching. The initial idea will be a simple cloud database structure which stores all the books, films and television that you have read and watched. This could initially be user input, however could extend further down the development path to use AI and machine learning to understand what you have ordered through streaming services or online orders or reviews as examples. Based on this stored information further suggestions will be put forward. This would require the use of data science, algorithms, AI and machine learning yet again.</p>
              <p>The scope initially can be quite small with perhaps just books, keeping a list of books you’ve read and then using open-source code from google or amazon to make recommendations and suggestions for further reading options. Further enhancements could include television and film options however the app can be expanded to include other media formats. The app could also catalogue and provide recommendations about places to shop, local events, potential vacation ideas along with restaurants and cafes. With everything that is going on in our lives, this app will be a short cut to what is happening around us and specifically tailored to our tastes and interests. </p>
              <p>There can be multiple modes for different audiences too.  A kid-friendly mode would be ideal and it could even be tailored to languages or cultures. Also, universities and other educational institutions could apply a subset of data to curate the lists to those recommended texts that are preferred by their institutions. </p>
              <p>Similarly, you could be sitting on the couch on a weekend wanting to watch a movie. Instead of trawling through all the different streaming options or googling “Funny Comedies” or “Popular Chickflicks” you could open your app and there is an immediate recommendation for you based on your history. As technology (particularly the Machine Learning algorithm) advances the fine tuning of these recommendations would be smarter and smarter. There could be a smart tv app version too which is aimed specifically at curating lists between streaming services.</p>
              <p>Imagine in the future, walking the streets of a foreign city, you open the app for recommendations and are led directly to something, be it a restaurant, shop or cultural attraction which is perfect for you based on everything you have shown interest in, in the past. You may have missed it. No guidebook is curated for you as an individual and although your friends are well meaning in telling you what you must watch/read/visit/eat that is their own taste and may not be compatible with your own.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <p>The interface is aimed to be simple in both appearance and usability. To start creating recommendations, the app will ask the user to input a few of the most and least favourite books, movies, tv shows and destinations/ POIs.</p>
              <p>The processing will be done in within the cloud with low levels of input from the user beyond their designing the curated lists.</p>
              <p>The nominated lists will be processed to generate further curated lists of books, movies, tv shows and destinations that the user may want to be presented with next. Regularly, the app will ask the user to provide feedback (out of 5 stars) of how accurate the results were for them. The app will then take this feedback and change their curated list to better reflect the user's preferences.</p>
              <p>The interface of the app is simply a list of recommendations, which can be sorted by nominated categories, such as books, television, genre, year of release, etc, also allowing the user to modify their preferences, lists and data at any time, to reflect in real-time curation of recommendations.</p>
              <p>One of many real-life situations of how the app could be used is as follows; the user is present in a bookstore browsing the shelves, they open the application, and it will have an immediate recommendation for you. From this action, the app has reduced the external environments pressure for selection and tailored and option directly generated on the user's interests.</p>

              <p>Mobile devices (both Apple and Android) will be required to run the application but in the future, it can be expanded to support smart TVs and other mobile devices.</p>
              <p>App development tools such as MIT app inventor will provide us with the resources to create the base platform of the app.</p>
              <p>Cloud-based toolset such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) for data depository and an area for to utilize marketplace plug-ins as open-source code for data manipulation orchestration this has built in AI and machine-learning code. This is customizable.</p>
              <p>However, to provide the user with more precise and accurate recommendations, the app must utilise a combination of Machine Learning and Cloud computing.</p>
              <p>The system will utilise semi-supervised machine learning model to both interpret and categorise the user data. The algorithm from launch will already be provided with a pre-built dataset with labels that it can use to classify user imported data independently. This learning model is optimal for the app since most of the user's data can be easily sorted based off the theme/ genre of the media stored in the database. Semi-supervised machine learning is also a highly efficient algorithm (compared to the other learning models) so it will be extremely useful when calculating recommendations for many users at any given time. With the use of semi-supervised machine learning in the app, the user will be able to receive more accurate results from the app without a long waiting time.</p>
              <p>Cloud computing and infrastructure models used by the team for development and deployment, the use of PaaS would be utilised by the team to achieve the end viable product for consumer use.</p>
              <p>PaaS can provide an infrastructure such as operating systems, data storage capabilities and application stacks for its use within the cloud. Long term, we would aim to achieve a cloud-based deployment model that would ensure ease of access and scalability.</p>
              <p>There are also other plug ins from Google to allow us to do further data analytics.</p>

              <p>This is a very difficult and highly specialised project idea. It is also somewhat futuristic and that is why we have outline opportunities for expansion. The initial app could be developed using any app development software for both apple and android devices and would require experienced app programmers. There will also be a cloud-based database storing information and this requires specific skills. The areas of specialization would be in data science, AI understanding and machine learning to analyse the data and formulate the recommendations, this is a highly complex field. The available open-source code to do this may also be limiting.</p>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <p>Today, our data is actively used by corporations to drive our behaviours and direct us towards opportunities that more times than not, return a profit to appease the stakeholders. This cycle of putting business interests above that of the population, is all too common. In recent times, there has been movements for the population to be more engaged in understanding big data and asking the questions revolving around the who, why, what, where, and how.</p>
              <p>There is no doubt that data is a future resource, more so as the world becomes more connected. We can and should have and take more oversight of the data we generate in our connected lives and empower ourselves to use it for purposes that enhance and develop our lives.</p>
              <p>With the goal of this project to be centred around the empowerment of people understanding how their data can be utilised either for or against the best interests of the population, in comparison to that of business interests; we hope that this would further on the debate in a public forum for the masses to partake in.</p>
              <p>By introducing a user-controlled competitor that very much goes against the ‘big data grab’ initiatives of corporations; and spurring on the debate of meta data and its use, we would like to see a shift in the willingness of corporations to change the way data is used and accessed to target masses for market gain.</p>
